Hi. I'm Dan. Congrats, you found my website.


# About

I had an unorthodox start to my IT career, having bounced through culinary, delivery and customer service jobs in my professional life. I'm passionate about keeping people and their data safe. To this end, I currently work for [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com)'s Security Operations team. in a security operations and incident response role.

Aside from a brief stint in culinary training, I'm entirely self-taught. My resume/CV is linked above.

This website isn't really about my professional life/accomplishments; it's a brain dump of sorts. I'm unable to discuss most of my work at Amazon in depth, and I tend to write whatever's on my mind. This site will forever be a work in progress.
