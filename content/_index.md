Hi. I'm Dan. Congrats, you found my website.


# About

I had an unorthodox start to my IT career, having bounced through culinary, delivery and customer service jobs in my professional life. I'm passionate about keeping people and their data safe. 

I most recently worked for [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com)'s Security Operations team. in a security operations and incident response role. I co-founded AWS's security researcher outreach program during my tenure.

Aside from a brief stint in culinary training, I'm entirely self-taught. My resume/CV is linked above.

This website isn't really about my professional life/accomplishments; it's a brain dump of sorts. I'm unable to discuss most of my work at Amazon in depth, and I tend to write whatever's on my mind. This site will forever be a work in progress.
