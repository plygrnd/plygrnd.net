I had an unorthodox start to my IT career, having bounced through culinary, delivery and customer service jobs in my professional life. I acquired a passion for IT security during my tenure in Amazon.com customer service, and retain a passion for helping my customers. This passion inspires me to devise novel methods to keep data, and people, safe.

Aside from a brief stint in culinary training, I'm entirely self-taught.

I currently work for [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com) in a security operations and incident response role.
